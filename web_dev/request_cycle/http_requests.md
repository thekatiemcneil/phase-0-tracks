What are some common HTTP status codes?
The status codes are broken up based on the number they begin with. For example, codes in the 200s are codes that were successful. Codes in the 300s indicate a redirection from the original request. 400-level codes are client-error codes. Codes in the 500s are server errors. Some common error codes include 200 (OK), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 502 (Bad Gateway).

What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
A GET request requests data from a specified source. This might be used to request an HTML sheet or stylesheet for a website. A POST reuqest submits data for processing for a specific source. This could be used when submitting a form, like registering for a website.

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
Cookies are files stored on a users computer. They contain website-specific information about a user that is used to customize the website to that user. The cookie contains key data pairs, like firstname, Katie; lastname, McNeil. The cookie can be read and retrieved by the web server to use the information on the website. These are transmitted during the HTTP requests.
