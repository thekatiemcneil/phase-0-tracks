**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system of keeping track of and recording changes made to a set of code, for example, Git. This is useful and important because code is so valuable. If you spend a chunk of time on a piece of code and then something happens to your computer, your code is gone. If you have version control, you can recall the code using a different machine. As well, if you make a mistake in your code or change the plan of what you're doing, you can use version control to recall a previous version of the code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the code on version control that you specifically are working on. It is a replica of the master at that moment, but will not necesarily reflect the master forever. Branches are helpful because they allow multiple people to work on the code at the same time. As well, they allow the master code to remain untouched, as edits to the master can be detrimental without being reviewed.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a record of changes to the repository. It is a way of showing that you made a change, as well as hopefully recording a meaningful message as to why. The latter half is up to the work of the coder, so extra effort must be made to be effective.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two people are working on the same piece of the same code. When attempting to merge the changes, they won't reflect the same thing, so the git will show a merge conflict. It doesn't know which to accept as the proper change.
