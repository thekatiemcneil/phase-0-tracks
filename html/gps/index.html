<h1>Review and Reflect</h1>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? The purpose of semantic tags is to help organize your information in a meaningful way. It is especially useful for people who use page readers to understand content. I see 'section' as being most useful, especially in replacing div tags.</li>
  <li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? Browsers display elements in the order they are written on your code, top to bottom.</li>
  <li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I liked learning about creating snippets. I hadn't thought about that as a possibility, but now it seems obvious that it would be a feature. I think in the future, depending on my need, I'll create more snippets.</li>
  <li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? I think the most challenging concept for me was and will be determining the appropriate time to use the different semantic elements. The flowchart that was included was super helpful.</li>
