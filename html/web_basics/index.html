  <h1>Hello world</h1>
  <p>
    Did you know that you can have a pig as a housepet? This is a <strong>very</strong> exciting thing that many people don't realize. How cool is it that you can <em>live</em> with a <em>pig!</em>
    <h2>Why live with a pig?</h2>
      Now, you may be asking yourself why you'd want to live with a pig when you can live with a more conventional pet like a dog or a cat. Here are a few reasons why a pig is a great choice:
      <ul>
        <li>Contrary to popular belief, they are <em>very</em> clean.
        <li>They are quick learners. You can potty train a pig in as little as one day!</li>
        <li>They love belly rubs, and you love to give belly rubs. Right?</li>
        <li>They can be walked on a leash, which is obviously even more adorable than walking a puppy on a leash.</li>
      </ul>
      Now that you've decided that you must get yourself a pig, I'd like to give you a list of 6 ideas for pig names.
